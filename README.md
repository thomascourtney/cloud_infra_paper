## Abstract
Cloud monitoring technologies are becoming increasingly vital in guaranteeing efficient and effective cloud resource management. The requirement for powerful and dependable monitoring solutions has grown crucial as more enterprises employ cloud-based services. Numerous studies have been conducted on various elements of the Cloud, such as its characteristics, features, virtualization technologies, security, and privacy. However, there appears to be a dearth of in-depth examination of Cloud monitoring in these studies. To fill this void, this study provides a comprehensive assessment of Cloud monitoring. Our goal is to analyse and assess the most popular cloud monitoring programmes in terms of functionality, performance, and convenience of use. The research will involve an in-depth examination of each tool's major features and functions, such as monitoring, alerting, and notification, data visualisation and analysis, and interaction with other tools and technologies. The research will also evaluate the simplicity of use, degree of customization and setup necessary for each tool, as well as the quality of support and documentation provided. Finally, after the benchmark results are in, this project will recommend a cloud monitoring tool as well as its implementation.
